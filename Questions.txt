Questions
Q1. How did you make sure that the application can last?

- Using a Framework: The application is built using Laravel which follows the MVC architectural pattern. 
This provides a solid foundation for building scalable/dynamic applications.

-Input Validation: In the EmployeeController, there's input validation ($request->validate) 
to ensure that the data being added to the database meets certain criteria, which prevents corrupt or unexpected data from entering the system.

-Use of Templates: Leveraging Blade templating (welcome.blade.php) separates the presentation layer from the business logic, 
making the user interface easier to manage and update.

-The controller contains methods for creating and deleting employees, encapsulating the business logic away from the presentation, 
which helps in maintaining and updating the application logic.

-Scheduled Tasks: In QRAttendancePoster.js, the use of scheduled tasks (schedule.scheduleJob) 
for generating and updating PDFs ensures that the system can handle routine tasks autonomously.

-Error Handling: The application checks if an employee exists before attempting to delete it, 
preventing potential errors from occurring in case of invalid operations.


Q2. Do you have any suggestions for improvement for the companyâ€™s managers? How should they be prioritized?

-Comprehensive Error Logging: Implement a system for logging errors that can alert managers in real-time to any issues that arise.

-User Authentication and Authorization: Introduce user roles and permissions to control access to different parts of the application, 
ensuring that only authorized personnel can perform certain operations.

-Automated Testing: Develop a suite of automated tests to regularly check the functionality of the application, 
ensuring that new changes don't break existing features.

-User Activity Logs: Keep a log of user activities within the application to track changes 

-Performance Monitoring: Use tools to monitor the performance of the application and to alert managers if the system is slow or unresponsive/crashes.
